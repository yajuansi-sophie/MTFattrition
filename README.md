# MTF attrition adjustment

Analyzing data from the national U.S. Monitoring the Future panel study following four cohorts of individuals from modal ages 18 to 29/30, we systematically compare alternative approaches to analyzing longitudinal data with a wide range of substance use outcomes, and examine the sensitivity of inferences regarding substance use prevalence and trajectories as a function of college attendance to the approach used.

The attached RMD file includes all codes for data cleaning, descriptive summaries, attrition-adjusted weighting construction, and trajectory modeling.
